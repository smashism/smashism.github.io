#### The gist

With the impending deprecation of basic auth for the Jamf Pro API I took some time to update my computer+device cleanup scripts to use bearer-auth token to do the needful.

The main workflow is largely the same:
1. Run an advanced search for devices (computers or mobile devices)
2. Export a report that includes JSS IDs
3. Copy out the JSS ID column into the array in the appropriate script
4. ðŸ†• Run script and enter `jamfProURL`, `jssUser`, and `jssPassword` when prompted.

#### The scripts

Treat this post as a moment in time; these scripts may be fleeting! ðŸª½
