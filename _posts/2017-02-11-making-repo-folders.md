Hey y'all, I made a really short&#47;quick video on how to create a folder within a repo on Github.com. It's not something very obvious, so I thought a little video showing how it works would maybe help some folks out, especially those that rely on the web GUI rather than using Git&#47;GitHub Desktop.
