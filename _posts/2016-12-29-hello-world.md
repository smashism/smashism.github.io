## introducing smashism.github.io

Howdy, I've set up this space to post updates when I add or update one of my scripts. You can see my main Git account (here)[https://github.com/smashism].

## Flex theme

I'm using the Flex theme. Flex is open sourced on GitHub and is licensed under the [MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT). Feel free to contribute to it anytime!
